# Coverage-Path-Planning
The aim of the research is to develop heuristics for efficient coverage path planning in the presence of transmission as well as fuel constraints.


This repository contains the codes for the Mixed Integer Linear Programming solver using CPLEX software.It also contains the codes for a greedy lawn-mover pattern heuristic,cheapest insertion, nearest insertion heuristics

The hardware implementation and the mission files can be checked here.
